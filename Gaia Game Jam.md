I think it would be useful to aim for creating an intervention as part of [[Global Game Jam]] at the end of January this year. Iâ€™m thinking of proposing this here to the Voicing Gaia Production Team - as I believe this can from the basis of an alternative funding stream.

We have proposed creating a mobile application as part of the [[British Council Application]]. One way of imagining this application is that it is a game that we create through workshops during the project. We need to explore how this will work with relation to the [[Gaia Mobile App]].
