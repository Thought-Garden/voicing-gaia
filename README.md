# Voicing Gaia

Hi David - this is going okay, although I'm not nerdy enough yet.

That's OK :) I have linked to this on my local machinee using both Obsidian and HackMD.

I think we can all use HAckMD as an editor if we like? As long as we are part of the repo.

We can edit this file on GitHub as well then "sync" in HackMD.
