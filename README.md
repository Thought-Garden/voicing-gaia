# Voicing Gaia

Hi David - this is going okay, although I'm not nerdy enough yet.

That's OK :) I have linked to this on my local machinee using both Obsidian and HackMD.

I think we can all use HAckMD as an editor if we like? As long as we are part of the repo.

We can edit this file on GitHub as well then "sync" in HackMD. 

And with the HackMd Chrome extension you can just click on the "Edit HackMD" button that is added to the Gihub website by the Chrome extension.

I can also move the filee to another team in HackMD and the link remains good to the Github Readme.md file. This is true even though the hackMD file is named after the title - so it keeps track of thee filename on GitHub.
