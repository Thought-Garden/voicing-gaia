Positive Cartography is a way to stimulate/inspire people and communities to think seriously about the kind of futures they want - their 'desired' futures - and take initial steps to help achieve them.

One aspect of Positive Cartography is that it uses images (photo's, icons, drawings) to help express ideas.
It is about visual thinking - not just cognitive word-making.
Ideally, this allows people from different backgrounds - countries, cultures, languages - to communicate more deeply.

Ideally, it is about world-building, using images and words to reinforce each other. Worlds that will not fall apart the next time the wind blows.

There's a lot more to tell
