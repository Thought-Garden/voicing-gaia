We can all use HackMD as an editor if we like, as long as each user is an authorised user as part of the repo or organisation on GitHub. This is in order to allow pushing to the repo. In summary it seems to work pretty well with regar to working with HackMD, Obsidian and or directly editing in the Github web site.

We can edit this file on GitHub as well then "sync" in HackMD. 

And with the HackMd Chrome extension you can just click on the "Edit HackMD" button that is added to the Gihub website by the Chrome extension.

I can also move the file to another team in HackMD and the link remains good to the Github Readme.md file. This is true even though the hackMD file is named after the title - so it keeps track of the filename on GitHub.

I can also edit using Obsidian. So now we are able to edit using GitHub web site, HackMd and Obsidian.
